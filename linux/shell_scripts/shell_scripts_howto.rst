linux shell scripts how-tos
===========================

adding paths
____________



PATH=$PATH:~/opt/bin
PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH

depending on whether you want to add ~/opt/bin at the end (to be searched after all other directories, in case there is a program by the same name in multiple directories) or at the beginning (to be searched before all other directories).

You can add multiple entries at the same time. PATH=$PATH:~/opt/bin:~/opt/node/bin or variations on the ordering work just fine.

You don't need export if the variable is already in the environment: any change of the value of the variable is reflected in the environment.ยน PATH is pretty much always in the environment; all unix systems set it very early on (usually in the very first process, in fact).

If your PATH gets built by many different components, you might end up with duplicate entries. See How to add home directory path to be discovered by Unix which command? and Remove duplicate $PATH entries with awk command to avoid adding duplicates or remove them.

Where to put it
Note that ~/.bash_rc is not read by any program, and ~/.bashrc is the configuration file of interactive instances of bash. You should not define environment variables in ~/.bashrc. The right place to define environment variables such as PATH is ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_profile if you don't care about shells other than bash). See What's the difference between them and which one should I use?

Notes on shells other than bash
In bash, ksh and zsh, export is special syntax, and both PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH and export PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH do the right thing even. In other Bourne/POSIX-style shells such as dash (which is /bin/sh on many systems), export is parsed as an ordinary command, which implies two differences:

~ is only parsed at the beginning of a word, except in assignments (see How to add home directory path to be discovered by Unix which command? for details);
$PATH outside double quotes breaks if PATH contains whitespace or \[*?.
So in shells like dash, export PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH sets PATH to the literal string ~/opt/bin/: followed by the value of PATH up to the first space. PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH (a bare assignment) doesn't require quotes and does the right thing. If you want to use export in a portable script, you need to write export PATH="$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH", or PATH=~/opt/bin:$PATH export PATH (or PATH=$HOME/opt/bin:$PATH export PATH for portability to even the Bourne shell that didn't accept export var=value and didn't do tilde expansion).

Linux determines the executable search path with the $PATH environment variable. To add directory /data/myscripts to the beginning of the $PATH environment variable, use the following:
PATH=/data/myscripts:$PATH
To add that directory to the end of the path, use the following command:
PATH=$PATH:/data/myscripts
But the preceding are not sufficient because when you set an environment variable inside a script, that change is effective only within the script. There are only two ways around this limitation:
If, within the script, you export the environment variable it is effective within any programs called by the script. Note that it is not effective within the program that called the script.
If the program that calls the script does so by inclusion instead of calling, any environment changes in the script are effective within the calling program. Such inclusion can be done with the dot command or the source command. Examples:
. $HOME/myscript.sh
source $HOME/myscript.sh
Inclusion basically incorporates the "called" script in the "calling" script. It's like a #include in C. So it's effective inside the "calling" script or program. But of course, it's not effective in any programs or scripts called by the calling program. To make it effective all the way down the call chain, you must follow the setting of the environment variable with an export command.

As an example, the bash shell program incorporates the contents of file .bash_profile by inclusion. So putting the following 2 lines in .bash_profile:
PATH=$PATH:/data/myscripts
export PATH
effectively puts those 2 lines of code in the bash program. So within bash the $PATH variable includes $HOME/myscript.sh, and because of the export statement, any programs called by bash have the altered $PATH variable. And because any programs you run from a bash prompt are called by bash, the new path is in force for anything you run from the bash prompt.

The bottom line is that to add a new directory to the path, you must append or prepend the directory to the $PATH environment variable within a script included in the shell, and you must export the $PATH environnment variable. The only remaining question is: In which script do you place those two lines of code?
Adding to a Single User's Path
To add a directory to the path of a single user, place the lines in that user's .bash_profile file. Typically, .bash_profile already contains changes to the $PATH variable and also contains an export statement, so you can simply add the desired directory to the end or beginning of the existing statement that changes the $PATH variable. However, if .bash_profile doesn't contain the path changing code, simply add the following two lines to the end of the .bash_profile file:
PATH=$PATH:/data/myscripts
export PATH
Adding to All Users' Paths (except root)
You globally set a path in /etc/profile. That setting is global for all users except user root. Typical /etc/profile files extensively modify the $PATH variable, and then export that variable. What that means is you can modify the path by appending or prepending the desired directory(s) in existing statements modifying the path. Or, you can add your own path modification statements anywhere before the existing export statement. In the very unlikely event that there are no path modification or export statements in /etc/profile, you can insert the following 2 lines of code at the bottom of /etc/profile:

PATH=$PATH:/data/myscripts
export PATH
Adding to the Path of User root
User root is a special case, at least on Mandrake systems. Unlike other users, root is not affected by the path settings in /etc/profile. The reason is simple enough. User root's path is set from scratch by its .bash_profile script. In order to add to the path of user root, modify its .bash_profile.
Summary
A fundimental administration task is adding directories to the execution paths of one or more users. The basic code to do so is:
PATH=$PATH:/data/myscripts
export PATH
Place that code, or whatever part of that code isn't already incorporated, in one of the following places:


Fast file editing
_________________


substitute
----------

most simple replacement:

    sed 's/day/night/' old >new

removing something and print:

    sed  's/'$target_spec_dir'//p' 

multiple substitutions with one sed command

    sed -i "s/MDO_growth_//; s/_OD600.*/ /" *.DAT 

remove MDO_varioskan_ and _ from MDO_varioskan_0638_

    sed "s/MDO_varioskan_//; s/_\s/  /" 

    -i : in-place edit

    echo "This is just a test" | sed -e 's/ /_/g' -> This_is_just_a_test


Comparing directories

Using getopt[s]
---------------

from: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035#getopts

Never use getopt(1). getopt cannot handle empty arguments strings, or arguments with embedded whitespace. Please forget that it ever existed.

The POSIX shell (and others) offer getopts which is safe to use instead. Here is a simplistic getopts example:

#!/bin/sh

# A POSIX variable
OPTIND=1         # Reset in case getopts has been used previously in the shell.

# Initialize our own variables:
output_file=""
verbose=0

while getopts "h?vf:" opt; do
    case "$opt" in
    h|\?)
        show_help
        exit 0
        ;;
    v)  verbose=1
        ;;
    f)  output_file=$OPTARG
        ;;
    esac
done

shift $((OPTIND-1))

[ "$1" = "--" ] && shift

echo "verbose=$verbose, output_file='$output_file', Leftovers: $@"

# End of file
The advantages of getopts are:

It's portable, and will work in e.g. dash.
It can handle things like -vf filename in the expected Unix way, automatically.
The disadvantage of getopts is that it can only handle short options (-h, not --help) without trickery.

There is a getopts tutorial which explains what all of the syntax and variables mean. In bash, there is also help getopts, which might be informative.



Straight Bash Space Separated
-----------------------------

Usage   ./myscript.sh -e conf -s /etc -l /usr/lib /etc/hosts 

#!/bin/bash
# Use -gt 1 to consume two arguments per pass in the loop (e.g. each
# argument has a corresponding value to go with it).
# Use -gt 0 to consume one or more arguments per pass in the loop (e.g.
# some arguments don't have a corresponding value to go with it such
# as in the --default example).
# note: if this is set to -gt 0 the /etc/hosts part is not recognized ( may be a bug )
while [[ $# -gt 1 ]]
do
key="$1"

case $key in
    -e|--extension)
    EXTENSION="$2"
    shift # past argument
    ;;
    -s|--searchpath)
    SEARCHPATH="$2"
    shift # past argument
    ;;
    -l|--lib)
    LIBPATH="$2"
    shift # past argument
    ;;
    --default)
    DEFAULT=YES
    ;;
    *)
            # unknown option
    ;;
esac
shift # past argument or value
done
echo FILE EXTENSION  = "${EXTENSION}"
echo SEARCH PATH     = "${SEARCHPATH}"
echo LIBRARY PATH    = "${LIBPATH}"
echo "Number files in SEARCH PATH with EXTENSION:" $(ls -1 "${SEARCHPATH}"/*."${EXTENSION}" | wc -l)


Straight Bash Equals Separated
-------------------------------

#!/bin/bash

for i in "$@"
do
case $i in
    -e=*|--extension=*)
    EXTENSION="${i#*=}"
    shift # past argument=value
    ;;
    -s=*|--searchpath=*)
    SEARCHPATH="${i#*=}"
    shift # past argument=value
    ;;
    -l=*|--lib=*)
    LIBPATH="${i#*=}"
    shift # past argument=value
    ;;
    --default)
    DEFAULT=YES
    shift # past argument with no value
    ;;
    *)
            # unknown option
    ;;
esac
done
echo "FILE EXTENSION  = ${EXTENSION}"
echo "SEARCH PATH     = ${SEARCHPATH}"
echo "LIBRARY PATH    = ${LIBPATH}"
echo "Number files in SEARCH PATH with EXTENSION:" $(ls -1 "${SEARCHPATH}"/*."${EXTENSION}" | wc -l)
if [[ -n $1 ]]; then
    echo "Last line of file specified as non-opt/last argument:"
    tail -1 $1
fi
To better understand ${i#*=} search for "Substring Removal" in this guide. It is functionally equivalent to `sed 's/[^=]*=//' <<< "$i"` which calls a needless subprocess or `echo "$i" | sed 's/[^=]*=//'` which calls two needless subprocesses.

Finding Duplicates
___________________

1.

    find -not -empty -type f -printf "%s\n" | sort -rn | uniq -d | xargs -I{} -n1 find -type f -size {}c -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 --all-repeated=separate 

Find Duplicate Files (based on size first, then MD5 hash) 
This dup finder saves time by comparing size first, then md5sum, it doesn't delete anything, just lists them. 

2.
    find -type f -exec md5sum '{}' ';' | sort | uniq --all-repeated=separate -w 33 | cut -c 35- 

3. Find Duplicate Files (based on MD5 hash) 
Calculates md5 sum of files. sort (required for uniq to work). uniq based on only the hash. use cut ro remove the hash from the result. 

    find -type d -name ".svn" -prune -o -not -empty -type f -printf "%s\n" | sort -rn | uniq -d | xargs -I{} -n1 find -type d -name ".svn" -prune -o -type f -size {}c -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 --all-repeated=separate 

Find Duplicate Files, excluding .svn-directories (based on size first, then MD5 hash) 
Improvement of the command "Find Duplicate Files (based on size first, then MD5 hash)" when searching for duplicate files in a directory containing a subversion working copy. This way the (multiple dupicates) in the meta-information directories are ignored. 
Can easily be adopted for other VCS as well. For CVS i.e. change ".svn" into ".csv": 
find -type d -name ".csv" -prune -o -not -empty -type f -printf "%s\n" | sort -rn | uniq -d | xargs -I{} -n1 find -type d -name ".csv" -prune -o -type f -size {}c -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 --all-repeated=separate 


4.

    find -not -empty -type f -printf "%-30s'\t\"%h/%f\"\n" | sort -rn -t$'\t' | uniq -w30 -D | cut -f 2 -d $'\t' | xargs md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 --all-repeated=separate 

Find Duplicate Files (based on size first, then MD5 hash) 

Finds duplicates based on MD5 sum. Compares only files with the same size. Performance improvements on: 

    find -not -empty -type f -printf "%s\n" | sort -rn | uniq -d | xargs -I{} -n1 find -type f -size {}c -print0 | xargs -0 md5sum | sort | uniq -w32 --all-repeated=separate 

The new version takes around 3 seconds where the old version took around 17 minutes. The bottle neck in the old command was the second find. It searches for the files with the specified file size. The new version keeps the file path and size from the beginning. 

5.
    find . -type f -exec md5 '{}' ';' | sort | uniq -f 3 -d | sed -e "s/.*(\(.*\)).*/\1/" 

Find Duplicate Files (based on MD5 hash) -- For Mac OS X 
This works on Mac OS X using the `md5` command instead of `md5sum`, which works similarly, but has a different output format. Note that this only prints the name of the duplicates, not the original file. This is handy because you can add `| xargs rm` to the end of the command to delete all the duplicates while leaving the original. 

6.
    fdupes -r . 

Find Duplicate Files (based on size first, then MD5 hash) 

If you have the fdupes command, you'll save a lot of typing. It can do recursive searches (-r,-R) and it allows you to interactively select which of the duplicate files found you wish to keep or delete.

HOW TO CREATE PATCH FILE USING PATCH AND DIFF

First, how to create patch file?

Patch file is a readable file that created by diff with -c (context output format). It doesnโt matter and if you wanna know more, man diff. To patch the entire folder of source codes(as usually people do)I do as bellow:
Assume Original source code at folder Tb01, and latest source code at folder Tb02. And there have multiple sub directories at Tb01 and Tb02 too.

    diff -crB Tb01 Tb02 > Tb02.patch

    -c context, -r recursive (multiple levels dir), -B is to ignore Blank Lines. 

I put -B because blank lines is really useless for patching, sometimes I need to manually read the patch file to track the changes, without -B is really headache. 

How to patch?
______________


First of all, please do a dry-run before really patch it. Bare in mind, patch will be working very specifically. Let say the version 3 Tb03.patch is use to patch from Tb02, if you apply patch on Tb01, sometimes it will corrupt your source code. So, to make sure it works, do a dry run. Dry-run means a fake-test, do it at the directory of the source code targeted to patch. 
Doing dry-run like this: 

patch --dry-run -p1 -i Tb02.patch 

The success output looks like this: 
patching file TbApi.cpp 
patching file TbApi.h 
patching file TbCard.cpp 
... 
The failure ouptut looks like this: 
patching file TbCard.cpp 
Hunk #2 FAILED at 585. 
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file TbCard.cpp.rej 
patching file TbCard.h 
Hunk #1 FAILED at 57. 
Hunk #2 FAILED at 77. 
Hunk #3 succeeded at 83 with fuzz 1 (offset -21 lines). 
.... 

At last, if the dry-run is giving good result, do this and enjoy the compilation. 

patch -p1 -i Tb02.patch 

Mounting a WebDAV directory in Linux (Ubuntu)
_____________________________________________

In this way you don't need to use terminal all the time to mount/umount a WebDav directory as nautilus  can be used easily. The steps are as follows.

1. Install davfs
2 # sudo apt-get install davfs2 Reconfigure davfs2 to enable to use davfs under unprivileged users # sudo dpkg-reconfigure davfs2 Edit /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf to enable automatic credentials use.  Uncomment the line secrets ~/.davfs2/secrets Edit ~/.davfs2/secrets file to add credentials to remote WebDav diectory. Add a line to the end of file in following style: https://<WebDav URI>   <username> <password> Set the permission:  # chmod 600 ~/.davfs2/secrets Add a line to /ect/fstab about the remote WebDav directory https://<WebDav URI> <mount point> davfs user,noauto,file_mode=600,dir_mode=700 0 1 Add your user to the davfs2 group # sudo vi /etc/group Add your username as follows: davfs2:x:134:<username> That's it. You can use following commands without being a root user to mount/umount # mount <mount point> # umount <mount point> You can also use nautilus to mount/umount the directory.
